CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing is defined as the use of hosted services, 
such as data storage, servers, databases, networking, and
software over the internet. Since cloud computing began,
the world has witnessed an explosion of cloud-based 
applications and services in IT, which continue to expand.
Almost every application we use resides on the cloud,
helping us save storage space, expenses, and time. 
This article discusses the types of cloud computing and 
10 trends to watch out for.

Cloud Computing Architecture:
Instead of storing files on a storage device or hard drive,
a user can save them on cloud, making it possible to access 
the files from anywhere, as long as they have access to the 
web. The services hosted on cloud can be broadly divided 
into infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service
(PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). Based on the 
deployment model, cloud can also be classified as public, 
private, and hybrid cloud.

Further, cloud can be divided into two different layers, 
namely, front-end and back-end. The layer with which users 
interact is called the front-end layer. This layer enables a 
user to access the data that has been stored in cloud through 
cloud computing software.

Types of Cloud Computing:

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Platform as a service (PaaS)
Software as a service (SaaS)

Amazon Web Services:
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading top platform in 
providing the web services of various domains. AWS follows 
the trends of digital IT and comes up needy services with 
optimized performances covering a wide range of services from 
Compute to Storage. It covers a wider range of customers of 
different domains to expand their business operations. This
